The goal of this project is to develop a code that reads the data from the fahrenheit temperature file and then create a new file with the data of fahrenheit converted to celsius using the data from the fahrenheit temperature file. I believe I demonstrated my understanding on how to read and write files using C++. I do need to improve on understanding on how to obtain the data from a file and use it to calculate or to convert into another number (or manipulate the data). I like to use whitespace to better organie and improve the readability of my code as well as adding comments to explain what I want it to do. The skills I have mentioned in this paragraph would be useful for other projects and course work.
