The goal is to understand how to integrate Python and C++. I struggled with trying to figure out how to properly output the multiplication table. I originally used
C++ instead of Python to create a multiplication table code. With the help from my professor, I was able to properly output the multiplication table using Python
and using C++ to call out the functions. Understanding how to integrate 2 languages will be beneficial when it comes to coding projects. Python is best used for 
readability and C++ is great for OOP functions.
