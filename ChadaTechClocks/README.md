The goal is to give the user the ability to add an hour, a minute, or a second to both the 12-hour format and the 24-hour format. This code demonstrated my 
understanding in using if/if-else/else function. I would improve this code by trying to use real, current time. The most challenging part about this code is trying
to make sure the hours roll over from 12 to 1 and from 23 to 0, as well as 59 to 0 for both minute and second. With the help from my professor, I was able to 
successfully use a functional code that ensures the numbers roll over to the correct number instead of it being indefinite.
